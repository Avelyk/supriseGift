                    <p>To My Dearest Bby,</p>
                    <p> As im about to head off to pursue my dreams, I would like to give you this as my gift before 
                        we temporarily part ways, I know things will not be easy and comforting without each others 
                        company at times, but dont worry memew, I am always one call or chat away and I will still be 
                        there. as I tell you every day, I love you. I love you and I will always do so even when we are 
                        far away from each other. I will try my best to visit you not just for your sake but also for 
                        mine because I will surely miss you so much bby TwT I will miss hanging out with you wether it is 
                        at our house, workflow, walking around the mall, around the city or even just following you wherever 
                        you are about to go. I will surely miss everything we do together this past few years. Even though it 
                        may look like it hasnt been long at our calendar, we still have made so much memories that I will 
                        surely cherish deep inside and remenisce and probably cry about sometimes TwT deep down I would also 
                        want to be with you all the time and make more of those precious memories we make all the time together. 
                        But right now we have dreams we want to focus to achieve. Before you begin college, I would PROBABLY 
                        NOT be the first to say, To enjoy urself to the fullest. I want you to smile all the time just as you 
                        do with me, laugh as loud as you'd like, brainrot/ADHD as always‚ú® as a and most importantly, be happy 
                        with yourself and that would be more than enough for me my love. All i ever want for you is whats 
                        best(not to sound like a parent here lmao). If ever pud ga lisod ka sa college DUN BE SHY TO REACH OUT 
                        TO OTHER BBY okie~~ muah, naa bitaw kay kaila na maka tabang nimo. especially ur smort kuyaa hehe. Muah 
                        ü•π I love you mamaw. I love you so much ga hilak nako üò≠ I will miss you so much but i know one day we 
                        will be able to have all the time for ourselves and once we do I would come to you and look forward for 
                        what lies ahead of us then. You are the most precious person in my life, you gave so much sunshine in my 
                        life that I wake up every morning looking forward to speak with you again. remember that I always appreciate 
                        you and everything you have done for me too. You were always there to support me, encourage me, comfort me, 
                        and even badlong mi üòÉ. You have alway's been understanding, patient, kind, and even generous. You are more 
                        than what I have dreamed of, you have no idea how much you make me feel, how much you touch me üëÄ. You make 
                        me feel so loved everyday and it's the best thing you have ever given me out of everything you offered. I 
                        can't imagine a life without you in mind, I can't imagine a day where i would not hear from you, see your 
                        cute face, giving you muah muahs, smelling you, nom nom you or even longing for you, missing you, and loving 
                        you. Youre there always when I am sad, when I am happy, or when im also mad. I want you to continue loving 
                        me forever and I want to continue loving you forever too ‚ô•Ô∏è. I love youuu so much my sweetest and most loving bby~~</p>
